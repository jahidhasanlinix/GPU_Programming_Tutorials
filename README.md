## About

This repository contains hands-on GPU programming tutorials that cover fundamental concepts and practical implementations using CUDA. Each tutorial includes detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help you understand GPU computing from the ground up.

**Target Audience:** Beginners to intermediate programmers interested in GPU computing and parallel programming.

**GPU Environment:**
- **GPU:** NVIDIA Tesla T4
- **CUDA Version:** 12.8.0

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of C/C++ programming
- Understanding of basic computer science concepts (arrays, functions, pointers)
- Access to a CUDA-capable GPU (NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 2.0 or higher)
- CUDA Toolkit installed on your system
- A C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

## Setup

### Installing CUDA Toolkit

1. Download the CUDA Toolkit from [NVIDIA's official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

### Compiling CUDA Programs

To compile a CUDA program, use the `nvcc` compiler:

```bash
nvcc -o program_name program_name.cu
```

### Running CUDA Programs

```bash
./program_name
```

## Tutorials

### Chapter 1: Vector Addition

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics Covered:** Basic CUDA kernel, thread indexing, memory operations

Learn the fundamentals of GPU programming by implementing element-wise vector addition. This tutorial introduces you to:
- Writing your first CUDA kernel
- Understanding thread blocks and grid dimensions
- Basic GPU memory operations
- Launching kernels from the host
